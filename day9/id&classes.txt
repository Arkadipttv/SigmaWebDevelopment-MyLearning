ID and Classes

Say for example yu have an aadhaar card.

Now your friend will also have that aadhar card but with different number.

example

1. Amit - 4578671
2. Rick - 5694677

Both of them are different people and their aadhaar card numbers are different

this is the concept of id.



now amit and rick go to a shop and amit buys mangoes and rick buys banana, both are yellow coloured so they fall in a class yellow.

Also, both are human beings so they fall under the class Human Being as well. XD!!!

So a person may belong to more than one class.
But, a person will only have one ID. ID is unique.

Class consists of a group of items that exhibit the same /similar kind of behaviour.
